ALTERNATIVE VARIANT: TRADE + FLOW COMBINED:
TRADE
-----
    ID (my sequence based so purely flow ones also receive unique id)
    TRADE_TS
    TRADETYPE (CASH, FXSPOT, BOND)
    ACCOUNT_ID (for transfers - source account? like in iBank/Quicken...)
    SOURCE_SYSTEM_TRADE_ID (null for non-trade related flows)
    UPLOAD_ID
    TODO: WE NEED STATUS AND EOD PROCESSES SO WE LOOK ONLY AT OPEN TRADES WHEN CALCULATING SUM AT DAY X!
    Also it will allow subdividing profit into real (settled into cash) and projected (based on pv estimate of unfinished trade like bond...)



CASH
----
    TRADE_ID
    AMOUNT
    CCY
    PURPOSE (INFLOW, OUTFLOW, TAX, COUPON, AMORTIZATION, EXCH FEE, BROKER FEE, NKD)
    REASON_TRADE_ID (for stuff where we know e.g. bond which produced NKD/EXCH/BROKER fees...)
    REASON_INSTR_ID (we need it for coupons/dividends - they are not paid for particular trade but for whole num of shares...)
    TRG_ACCOUNT_ID (for transfers. TODO: where is BTB side? it looks it should not be called trg_acct. there will
    be just two accts with btb deals, one will have one acct as source another as trg, other in reverse?..)

FXSPOT - in my variant these don't settle into cash - so we'll need to account for them while getting total ccys amount...
TODO: BUT THEY WILL NEED TO SETTLE INTO CASH AND IT'S WHAT BROKER REPORTS HAVE AS WELL IF WE THINK. SO AFTER SOME FAR DATE
when we need to get number of money we don't count all past FxSpot deals, we assume they alreday closed and settled
into Cash so we just sum cash for ccys. And for FxSpots we calculate only open ones at day we're looking.
----
    TRADE_ID
    SETTLEMENT_DATE (for consistency I may assume acc ccy disappears also on this date not on trade date, otw there
    will be holes where one ccy left and another appeared after 1b)
    STRIKE (price of 1)
    NOTIONAL (with sign)
    UNDER_CCY
    ACCNOTIONAL (=-NOTIONAL*STRIKE)
    ACC_CCY


BOND
----
    TRADE_ID
    SETTLEMENT_DATE
    INSTR_ID (NULL?)
    NOTIONAL (for bonds notional is price of 1 bond, not num of bonds)
    NUM_SHARES
    PRICE_OF_1
    AMOUNT
    REFERENCE_YTM
    REFERENCE_DURATION

COUPON_SCHEDULE - do I need it? does moex keep info forever? otherwise I can't calc ytm/duration.
I queried bond which expired >1y ago, moex still returned its schedule so may postpone

ACCOUNT
-------
    ID
    NAME
    CLIENT_ID
    PARENT_ACC_ID? (NULL for main account else subaccounts)
    CCY (needed? contradictory... at one hand 'external' accts have ccy (RUB, $) but FX acct inside investment acct has ccy more like securities or subaccts...)
    (also, if ccy here then why Flow needs Ccy?)

CLIENT (client of a program if we turn it into a site)

UPLOAD (broker specific?...)
------
    ID
    FILENAME?
    ACCOUNT_ID (to main, not sub, account)
    TYPE (monthly, daily) - e.g. don't let upload daily report if we loaded monthly.
    TODO: can just add start/end date for which we upload, will decouple from one broker
    TS (when we uploaded)

Queries:
1) Find how much of each instrument I have at date X
2) find how much I'm worth at date X - that's 1) multiplied by price of instruments at date X (or closest date to it)
Another algorithm:
    - Find trades open at date X
    - For each such trade find its PV
    - Sum PVs
PV of a bond could be just num shares * priceof1
PV of fxspot could be accnotional
PV of cash is just amount

Questions:
1) how to express fx deals? 1 line or 2?
2) how to express money transfer from subaccount to subaccount? from external to subaccount?
3) are FX RUB, FX USD, FX EUR distinct subaccounts or just kinds of securities on one subaccount FX?
4) Is RUB a "security" or is it special?
5) if each ccy is subaccount, then should we create btb deals when buying eur for rub on both accounts?
6) if I represent 'external' money source as account too, I can code transfers to investment acct as sells from
'external' account and buys in e.g. fund or ccy subacct in inv acct. in this case it will be quick to find money
i invested - just sum sells from 'external' account.
7) maybe better join trades and flows tables? and represent flow without a trade as special trade?
8) who needs 'external' account? we can just leave corresp side of trade as null
9) if I join trade & flow, what would be trade id's of flow-only ops? I can leave existing trade id as opt field,
and insert my own sequence based id...
10) how do we represent sell of a security? it's not like we've given out some liability... We just sold N shares.
Do we insert one trade as a bond with "-" and another trade as a cash flow received for this?
